Brief Description of Project 

1) In this i have added 5 Chart as given in assignment(Note : For AgeDistribution Chart i have randomly taken age as age data is not in db)
2) I have added sorting option functionality in Employee table to sort Employee data alphabetically with pagination of 6 employee per page
3) I have added Search bar filter functionality to serach employee based on name and department and will show data of employee as items with pagination of 4 employee per page.
4) I have apped Update and delete functionality of Employee
5) I have added Create Employee functionality
6) I have added to check details of employee functionality

In last i will say i have really very enjoyed to make this assignment i hope i have covered all functionlity . only in last i will say to first add data in your db before checking assignment (For that Go to Employee details button and click it and go to create New employee button and add atleast 10 data first) on running the project in local so you can check the Number of employee and average salary and graph more clearly.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you
Thank you so much
